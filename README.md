DragonVim
=========

This is designed to be an easy way to get setup with a version of vim that acts much like Sublime Text but more awesome and dragon like.

Base settings have been stolen from Jeff and Jesse. Colour Schemes provided include solarized and Dayles bajillion themes. I want BlueDawn. Port it kthx Dayle.

## Installation
Clone the repository, cd into it and run `make`.
Or copy paste this.
`[[ -d ~/.vim ]] || mkdir ~/.vim & git clone https://github.com/robclancy/dragonvim.git ~/.vim/dragonvim & cd ~/.vim/dragonvim & make`

## Uninstall
Why would you want to remove dragons? Ever. Anyway if you really want to just look in `~/.bashrc` and you will see what to remove.
